# Summarize Data for a NERRS Motus Station

## Overview

This report provides examples of how to summarize and display data from Motus stations in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The examples can also be adapted to any Motus station.  

In these examples, we explore data from the station named NCNERR - Masonboro Island. The report will show you how to prepare the necessary R packages, download Motus data, analyze and plot Motus data, and analyze Motus data in relation to the NERRS' [System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP)](https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/).   

The goal of these examples is to encourage users to perform similar analyses. To get started, you can copy code from the .html or .Rmd version of the file and paste into a new R script, and then edit the script to analyze your own data and modify the analyses and figures. Find the .html and .Rmd files in the docs folder. The .html version is also viewable at https://cape-fear-bird-observatory.github.io/NERRS-Motus-analysis/ 

These examples are meant to complement the results displayed in the [Motus dashboard](https://motus.org/). The methods are conducted with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) software and require you to have an introductory understanding of R. Advanced users may also wish to explore additional analyses using the [motus](https://motuswts.github.io/motus/) package in R.
